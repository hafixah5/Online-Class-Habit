# Online-Class-Habit

This project was done in Jupyter Notebook in which charts were used to convey the analysis.
The Visualization Tables folder contains the data used for Tableau visualization in xlsx format. It also contains a snapshot of the ![dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nu4818/viz/StudentsActivityduringPandemic/Dashboard1)
Some of the explored data shown are Class Ratings and Time Spent on Social Media.

This is a wordcloud made using the things the students missed during the pandemic.
